## :orange_book: The Challenge

[Free Form Data Challenge](https://github.com/dali-lab/dali-challenges/blob/master/docs/DataChallenge.md) 

## :muscle: Motivation

Haven't done much data visualization ever so might as well try something new and have fun for a Dali Challenge! I added in a little API work for fun too.


## :memo: What Was Attempted

- Extract person data from provided jsons
- Correctly display map image
- Use Plotly to map people to their locations
- Have info about the person in the markers
- Get refamilizarized with jupyter notebook

## Installations and technologies
- *Important Note* Plotly did not like Chrome, so you may need to switch to firefox or safari to render map
- Coded in jupyter notebook with python
- Plotly and Geopy Used

## End Result
